# Heat Health Action Plan Registry

This repository contains the heat-health action plans used in the analysis for the paper [*“A Critical Gap in Addressing Mental Health in Heat-Health Action Plans Worldwide.”*](https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/40418305/)

**Authors:** Allison Stewart-Ruano, Raenita Spriggs, Emma L. Lawrance, Alessandro Massazza, Alexandra Czerniewska, Alejandro Saez Reale, Joy Shumake-Guillemot, Katherine M. Keyes, Yoshira Ornelas Van Horne, Robbie M. Parks

To support continued research and access, this repository is being developed into a live, continually updated database of heat-health action plans. New plans can be submitted on the website and are automatically added to the registry and interactive website.
